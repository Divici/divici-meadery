## Divici's Meadery

An application used to track what Meads I'm currently working on as well as leave some tips on how to recreate my recipes. Built with React, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Status
This project is currently in development. Users can view a list of the different meads but can not yet view all details on selected mead. Will implement Tailwind CSS and redux to rebuild.

## Reflection

This was a side project built during 3rd month at BloomTech. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that listed the wide range of experimental meads as well as refined meads I have created over the last few years. It is also just a place to track what I'm currently working on as well as leave some tips on how to recreate my recipes. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.  

It is still a work in progress, and I would eventually like to rebuild it with `React Native` so that I can use it as both an app and web app.
